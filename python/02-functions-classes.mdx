# Python 02 Functions & Classes


## 2.0 Topics
1. Functions
2. Lambda functions
3. Modules
4. Classes

## 2.0.0 Operators: Recap & Extensikon
- Operators are _____
  - Logical operators
  - Arithmetic operators
  - Assignment operators
  - Comparison operators


### Membership Operators 
- Validates if (object) is member of (subject)
- 2 membership operators: `in` and `not in`


```
str1 = 'abc'
'a' in str1       # True
'g' not in str1   # True
```

### Identity Operators 
- Validates if (object) is of the same class as (type_of_class)
- 2 identity operators: `is` and `is not`


```
x = 5               # int
type(x) is int      # True
type(x) is not str  # True
```


## 2.1 Functions
- Blocks of reusable code to perform certain actions
  - reduces repetitive code, which saves time in long run (from compiling)
  - to structure program so logic of code is cleaner

### 2.1.1 Defining & Calling Functions
- Syntax to define function:
  - opens with `def`
  - functionname must start with letter, underscore
  - often ends with return; can end without too (eg print)

```
def function_name(input_1, input_2 ...):
   code block           # note ident
   return output        # ends here
```

- To call a function, simply write its name and input parameters
- e.g. `function_name(a, b)`

### 2.1.2 Argument types
- 4 categories; how function is called (1, 2) and how functions is defined (3, 4)
  1. Positional arguments:
    - 2 main requirements for PosArg
      - (1) arguments must be passed in the correct positional order
      - (2) # of input arguments must exactly match function-definition arguments
      - Otherwise, function will throw an error OR not run as expected
    - no need to define keywords if you pass them in precisely the expected order
    - e.g.
      ```
      def info(name, age):
        print(name, 'is', age, 'years old')
        
      info('Mike', 40)
      >> "Mike is 40 years old"
      info(40, 'Mike')
      >> "40 is Mike years old"
      ```
  2. Keyword arguments
    - See above; arguments do need not be in the correct order to be passed in
    ```
    info(age = 40, name = 'Mike')
      >> "Mike is 40 years old"          # position doesn't matter because keyword is defined
    ```
  3. Default arguments
    - Default value of input-arguments if not otherwise defined; must be defined during function definition
    - Default value will be overwritten if new value passed in
    ```
    def info(name, age=99):
        print(name, 'is', age, 'years old')
    info('Mike')
      >> "Mike is 99 years old"          # default value used
    info('Mike', 40)
      >> "Mike is 40 years old"          # default value overwritten
    ```
  4. Variable-length assignments
    - use of `*args` and `*kwargs`
      - `*args` allows us to create a list of future further arguments
       ```
      def info(name, *args):
          hobby = []
          for a in args:
            hobby.append(a)
          print(name, "hobbies: " + ','.join(hobby)
      info('Mike', 'hiking', 'reading', 'bananas')
        >> "Mike hobbies: hiking, reading, bananas"
      ```
      - `*kwargs` creates a dictionary that maybes keywords to arguments
       ```
      def info(name, **kwargs):
          hobby = []
          for k, v in kwargs.items():
            hobby.append(k + '-' + v)
          print(name, "hobbies: " + ','.join(hobby)
          
      info('Mike', first='hiking', loves='reading', hates='bananas')
        >> "Mike hobbies: likes-hiking, loves-reading, hates-bananas"
      ```

### 2.1.3 Return Types
- `return` terminates the execution of the function, and returns the output to the caller
  - `return` can return `None`, values, or other functions
    - `None`    :  if function has no return value, None is returned by default
    - Values    : returns numbers, collections, sequences of objects
      - Useful to for mathematical operations, eg create logistic functions
    - Functions : 
    ```
    def by_factor(factor):
       def multiply(number):
          return factor * number
       return multiply
    double = by_factor(2)       # double becomes equivalent to by_factor of factor 2; when number is received, returns factor * number
    double(2) 
    >> 4
    double(3)
    >> 6
    ```
    
### 2.1.4 Variable scopes
- Variables are only available within their "scopes";
  - `local` variables are declared within the body of the function and are only available within the function

  - `global` variables are declared outside and can be used anywhere


## 2.2 Lambda expressions

### 2.2.1 Lambda expression definitions:
- Similar to a function, takes in an input of argument_list and outputs based on expression
- lambda expressions don't have a name, and must be defined within a single line
- usually for simple tasks 
```
lambda argument_list: expression
lambda x, y: x*y                # multiplication output
lambda *args: sum(args)         # sum-all output
```

## 2.3 Modules

### 2.3.1 Module definition:
- A `module` contains functions & global variables
- `import module` imports the module
  - e.g. `import math` gives `pi` (global variable) and `sqrt`




## 2.4 Classes

### 2.3.1 Objects
- Everything in Py is an `object`; every object is an instance of a `type` or `class`
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24678048/189471964-ba466011-c580-4312-b4a6-f2bf5fe5a354.png)

- when defining something, e.g. `a = 2`, we create an object with a unique object `id`

- `a is b`: checks if object `a` has the same `id` as object `b`, e.g. same identity
- `a == b`: checks if object `a` has the same *`value`* as object `b`,

```
a = [1, 2]
b = [1, 2]
a is b         # False, would need to be b = a for definition
a == b         # True, contains same values
```

- Python caches integers in (-5, 256) inclusive; so assignments of small variables go to these places
  - If `a = 101` and `b = 101`, both will be tagged to the same cached object
  - But not if `a = 1001` and `b = 1001`, as both > 256

### 2.3.1b Copies
- if `a = 2` and `b = a`, actually, both a & b are pointers to the `2` objewct
  - modifying `b` **will also modify `a`** !!! 
-  alternatively, `b = copy.copy(a)` will create a separate object
  -  modifying `a` will not modify `a`
  -  however, it will only copy modify the parent layer, not the child layer; 
-  final option: `b = copy.deepcopy(a)` will create separate clones for each child object



### 2.3.1c Data Mutability
- strings, tuples, integers are not mutable
  - modifying strings really repoints the pointer to a different object, e.g. 
  ```
  string = 'hello'         # some object id
  string += 'i'
  string
  >> 'hello!'              # a different object id
  ```
- whereas lists, dictionaries, sets are mutable; modifying does not repoint object
  ```
  list = [1, 2]         # some object id
  list += [3]
  list
  >> [1, 2, 3]          # same object id
  ```
  
### 2.3.2 Classes
- Classes are blueprints / general form of objects
  - `objects` may be different, but are variations/follow same rules for `classes`
- we can use `__init__` to give objects attributes when creating them
```
class Student:
  def __init__(self, first, last):
    self.first = first
    self.last = last
  def fullname(self):
    return self.first + " " + self.last
 stu_1 = Student("Jean", "Chen")
 stu_1.fullname()
 >> Jean Chen
```
- we can also define num_of_stu within Student class as a count, such that when __init__ is run, num_of_stu += 1

### 2.3.3 Inheritance
- When creating child `class`es, we can have it inherit all functionalities of parent classes
```
class Rep(Student):     # Rep is now a child class to Student
  pass
rep_1 = Rep('Dai', 'Bingtian')
rep_1.fullname()
>> Dai Bingtian
```

- `Super Inheritance` can be used to have information be "inherited by default" from parent class
```
class Rep(Student):
  def __init__(self, first, last, cat):
    super().__init__(first, last) 
    self.cat = cat
rep_1 = Rep("Jean", "Chen", "Academic")
rep_1.fullname()
 >> Jean Chen
```

- Super Inheritance is in contrast to `Override Inheritance`, which takes over 

Super Inheritance` can be used to have information be "inherited by default" from parent class
```
class Rep(Student):
  ...
  
  def fullname(self):
    return self.cat + self.first + self.last

rep_1 = Rep("Jean", "Chen", "Academic")
rep_1.fullname()
 >> AcademicJeanChen
```

### 2.3.4 Magic Methods
- defined by starting and ending with double underscore
- can be checked using `dir()`
