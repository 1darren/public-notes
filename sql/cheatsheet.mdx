## Order of Operations 

```
SELECT
  column_name ,
  AGGREGATE(column_name)
FROM
  Table_Name
WHERE
  boolean_conditional
GROUP BY
  pivot_columns
HAVING
  secondary_conditional
ORDER BY
  sorting_column ASC, secondary_sorting DESC
LIMIT
  top_rows_to_select
  
  
```
### CTE Common Table Expressions
- to create a subtable with an alias you can SELECT from

```
WITH CTE_Table_1 AS 
  (
  SELECT 
    cte_column
   FROM
    cte_table
   WHERE
    cte_conditional
  ) ,
WITH CTE_Table_2 AS 
  (
  ...
  )

SELECT
  column
FROM 
  CTE_Table_1
JOIN 
  CTE_Table_2
ON
  CTE_Table_1.column = CTE_Table_2.column
```

### Windowing 
- to create a running total 
- in snippet below;
  - the `running_total` column creates an average

```
SELECT 
        start_time,
        start_terminal,
        duration,                       --running_total, duration, duration_seconds, start_terminal
        duration_seconds,
       SUM(start_terminal) OVER (ORDER BY duration_seconds, start_terminal) AS running_total
  FROM tutorial.dc_bikeshare_q1_2012
  ORDER BY
        duration_seconds ASC, start_terminal ASC
  
```
