# What is Data Analytics?
* collect & clean data
* uncover insights
* make critical decisions about results


* “Data-driven thinking”
	* Hear a stat, and be critical about data thinking
* Hire a data analyst;
	* Use the tools
	* Form a hypothesis
	* Analyse & communicate insights

## The Data Framework
1. Frame: Question that can be answered with data
Where is the most profitable Starbucks Location?

	1. Focus: Specific population or area in question
		* “Where should we open a new Starbucks … in US ?”
	2. Metric: Direct
		* “Where should we open a new Starbucks … based on GDP ?”

The frame defines the hypothesis; which then defines the data we need to test
	* Cities with higher GDP -> supports more starbkcs
	* {GDP per Capita by City}, {Which cities Starbucks are in}, {# of Starbucks per city}

2. Extract data & clean it
3. Wrangle - remove blanks, misspellings, inconsistencies
4. Analyse to identify relationships, patterns, trend
5. Interpret: See above
-> Return to Extract: identify new factors
-> return to Analyse: find other methods/techniques
6. Communicate: share insights

## How to write a hypothesis
	* What *participants*
	* in what circumstances
	* Experience what effects


## To-Do
